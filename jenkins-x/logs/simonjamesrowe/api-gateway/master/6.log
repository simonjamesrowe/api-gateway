        "content": "I'm the kind of person that learns by doing - the more I do, the more it sinks in. Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building blocks for building this dynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*. There was out of the box support for kubernetes flavours such as GKE (google cloud) and EKS (amazon web services), but a bit of customisation would be required if i wanted to run this on my local kubernetes cluster. This was easy enough and I was able to configure the following:\n- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) as the container registry of choice\n- [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - configure cert manager to generate lets encrpt certificates using ACME challennges based on my use of AWS Route 53 for dns.\n- Installed MongoDB in the control plane.\n\nOverall my initial architecture looked something like this:\n\n![Website V1](/uploads/Website_V1_c3889a1afa.jpeg)\n\n\n*All source code for this app can be found here: (https://github.com/simonjamesrowe)*",

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building blocks for building this d
ynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*.

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building blocks for building this d
ynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*. There was out of the box support for kubernetes flavours such as GKE (google cloud) and EKS (amazon web services), but a bit of customisation would be required if i wanted to run this on my local kubernetes cluster. This was easy enough and I was able to configure the following:\n- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) as the container registry of choice\n- [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - configure cert manager to generate lets encrpt certificates using ACME challennges based on my use of AWS Route 53 for dns.\n- Installed MongoDB in the control plane.\n\nOverall my initial architecture looked something like this:\n\n![Website V1](/uploads/Website_V1_c3889a1afa.jpeg)\n\n\n*All source code for this app can be found here: (https://github.com/simonjamesrowe)*","updated_by":{"isActive":true,"blocked":false,"roles":["5f6314095ee4c9001d2b959f"],"_id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696","username":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","email":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","createdAt":"2020-02-15T18:34:53.155Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-17T07:45:13.526Z","__v":0,"id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696"},"id":"5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1"}), headers={model=blog, id=c0c23ed0-4229-482d-75fa-6fe67d6452af, kafka_messageKey=blog-5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1, timestamp=1610490079857}]

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building bl
ocks for building this dynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*. There was out of the box support for kubernetes flavours such as GKE (google cloud) and EKS (amazon web services), but a bit of customisation would be required if i wanted to run this on my local kubernetes cluster. This was easy enough and I was able to configure the following:\n- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) as the container registry of choice\n- [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - configure cert manager to generate lets encrpt certificates using ACME challennges based on my use of AWS Route 53 for dns.\n- Installed MongoDB in the control plane.\n\nOverall my initial architecture looked something like this:\n\n![Website V1](/uploads/Website_V1_c3889a1afa.jpeg)\n\n\n*All source code for this app can be found here: (https://github.com/simonjamesrowe)*","updated_by":{"isActive":true,"blocked":false,"roles":["5f6314095ee4c9001d2b959f"],"_id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696","username":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","email":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","createdAt":"2020-02-15T18:34:53.155Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-17T07:45:13.526Z","__v":0,"id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696"},"id":"5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1"}), headers={model=blog, id=c0c23ed0-4229-482d-75fa-6fe67d6452af, kafka_messageKey=blog-5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1, timestamp=1610490079857}]

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I h
ad picked the basic building blocks for building this dynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*. There was out of the box support for kubernetes flavours such as GKE (google cloud) and EKS (amazon web services), but a bit of customisation would be required if i wanted to run this on my local kubernetes cluster. This was easy enough and I was able to configure the following:\n- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) as the container registry of choice\n- [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - configure cert manager to generate lets encrpt certificates using ACME challennges based on my use of AWS Route 53 for dns.\n- Installed MongoDB in the control plane.\n\nOverall my initial architecture looked something like this:\n\n![Website V1](/uploads/Website_V1_c3889a1afa.jpeg)\n\n\n*All source code for this app can be found here: (https://github.com/simonjamesrowe)*","updated_by":{"isActive":true,"blocked":false,"roles":["5f6314095ee4c9001d2b959f"],"_id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696","username":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","email":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","createdAt":"2020-02-15T18:34:53.155Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-17T07:45:13.526Z","__v":0,"id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696"},"id":"5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1"}), headers={model=blog, id=c0c23ed0-4229-482d-75fa-6fe67d6452af, kafka_messageKey=blog-5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1, timestamp=1610490079857}]

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building blocks for bu
ilding this dynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*. There was out of the box support for kubernetes flavours such as GKE (google cloud) and EKS (amazon web services), but a bit of customisation would be required if i wanted to run this on my local kubernetes cluster. This was easy enough and I was able to configure the following:\n- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) as the container registry of choice\n- [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - configure cert manager to generate lets encrpt certificates using ACME challennges based on my use of AWS Route 53 for dns.\n- Installed MongoDB in the control plane.\n\nOverall my initial architecture looked something like this:\n\n![Website V1](/uploads/Website_V1_c3889a1afa.jpeg)\n\n\n*All source code for this app can be found here: (https://github.com/simonjamesrowe)*","updated_by":{"isActive":true,"blocked":false,"roles":["5f6314095ee4c9001d2b959f"],"_id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696","username":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","email":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","createdAt":"2020-02-15T18:34:53.155Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-17T07:45:13.526Z","__v":0,"id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696"},"id":"5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1"}), headers={model=blog, id=c0c23ed0-4229-482d-75fa-6fe67d6452af, kafka_messageKey=blog-5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1, timestamp=1610490079857}]

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building blocks for building this dynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly
 good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*.

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building blocks for build
ing this dynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I had a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*. There was out of the box support for kubernetes flavours such as GKE (google cloud) and EKS (amazon web services), but a bit of customisation would be required if i wanted to run this on my local kubernetes cluster. This was easy enough and I was able to configure the following:\n- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) as the container registry of choice\n- [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - configure cert manager to generate lets encrpt certificates using ACME challennges based on my use of AWS Route 53 for dns.\n- Installed MongoDB in the control plane.\n\nOverall my initial architecture looked something like this:\n\n![Website V1](/uploads/Website_V1_c3889a1afa.jpeg)\n\n\n*All source code for this app can be found here: (https://github.com/simonjamesrowe)*","updated_by":{"isActive":true,"blocked":false,"roles":["5f6314095ee4c9001d2b959f"],"_id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696","username":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","email":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","createdAt":"2020-02-15T18:34:53.155Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-17T07:45:13.526Z","__v":0,"id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696"},"id":"5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1"}), headers={kafka_offset=0, scst_nativeHeadersPresent=true, kafka_consumer=org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer@7db6708e, deliveryAttempt=1, kafka_timestampType=CREATE_TIME, model=blog, kafka_receivedPartitionId=0, kafka_receivedMessageKey=blog-5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1, kafka_receivedTopic=LOCAL_EVENTS, kafka_receivedTimestamp=1610490080668, kafka_groupId=api-gateway}]

Whilst attempting to keep my skills up to date, I had the idea of building a rich web application which would serve up my CV, and it could also double as a place to hone and demonstrate my skillsets in certain technologies. Eventually, I could even start blogging about these experiences. \n\nThe first thing I decided I would need would be a CMS (Content Management System). The content of my website would have to be dynamic, as I would like to keep my CV and blog up to date.  There were many options available here, but I finally settled on a headless CMS named ([strapi](https://strapi.io/)). Strapi would also require some sort of persistence layer, and  [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ seemed to be a sensible choice.\n\nFor the web interface itself, there was a bit of competition between React and Angular. After spending years commercially working on Angular projects, I decided that React could be a good thing to learn and went with that.  \n\n```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript``` is the command used to boostrap my react SPA (single page application) and I found a boostrap template from [here](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).\n\nSo far so good right ? I had picked the basic building blocks for building this dynamic CV/blog, but where would I run it ? I ha
d a perfectly good iMac that was unused, and a fast enough internet connection. This app doesnt need to be highly available, as its just a little hobby app so this would suit well. I could use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make my app available to the internet, and I could use [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) to set up and configure my domain.\n\nKubernetes is a very popular way or running cloud native apps, so this was a pretty easy choice, the only issue was what flavour of it would work best on a mac. I started off with minikube, but started to have issues with persistent volumes, so eventually went with [kind (kubernetes in docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). I could easily install nginx ingress controller, and it was super easy to configure.\n\nThe last thing to consider was how to deploy the individual components or services to the kubernetes cluster. One of my requirements was that I would want to make continual improvments to my app, so the deployment process must be as simple as possible. I would want to have git projects for each service,  build a container image, and deploy a helm chart (a helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources).  [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) describes itself as *Jenkins X provides pipeline automation, built-in GitOps, and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale*. There was out of the box support for kubernetes flavours such as GKE (google cloud) and EKS (amazon web services), but a bit of customisation would be required if i wanted to run this on my local kubernetes cluster. This was easy enough and I was able to configure the following:\n- [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) as the container registry of choice\n- [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - configure cert manager to generate lets encrpt certificates using ACME challennges based on my use of AWS Route 53 for dns.\n- Installed MongoDB in the control plane.\n\nOverall my initial architecture looked something like this:\n\n![Website V1](/uploads/Website_V1_c3889a1afa.jpeg)\n\n\n*All source code for this app can be found here: (https://github.com/simonjamesrowe)*","updated_by":{"isActive":true,"blocked":false,"roles":["5f6314095ee4c9001d2b959f"],"_id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696","username":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","email":"simon.rowe@gmail.com","createdAt":"2020-02-15T18:34:53.155Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-17T07:45:13.526Z","__v":0,"id":"5e4839cd1c2d53001dcc0696"},"id":"5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1"}), headers={skip-input-type-conversion=true, kafka_offset=0, scst_nativeHeadersPresent=true, kafka_consumer=org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer@7db6708e, deliveryAttempt=1, kafka_timestampType=CREATE_TIME, model=blog, kafka_receivedPartitionId=0, kafka_receivedMessageKey=blog-5f0215c69d8081001fd38fa1, kafka_receivedTopic=LOCAL_EVENTS, kafka_receivedTimestamp=1610490080668, kafka_groupId=api-gateway}]
